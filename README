PyPandora is a python interface to Pandora http://www.pandora.com/ based on pianobar http://github.com/PromyLOPh/pianobar

It can either be used directly as a python module with an incredibly simple interface:

import pypandora
pypandora.login(username, password)
print pypandora.stations
pypandora.stations[0].play(True)

The rpcs server can be started with python -m "pypandora.rpc_server", by default it listens on port 8123
